# About the Author

![Mussarat Shamsher](https://mussarat-web-dev.vercel.app/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fprofile.993e3143.jpeg&w=1920&q=75)

Mussarat Shamsher is a software engineer and AI systems builder focused on designing and deploying modern, production-ready AI applications. Her work spans full-stack engineering, backend systems, and emerging agentic AI architectures.

She approaches AI not as isolated models, but as **end-to-end systems**—combining reasoning, retrieval, tooling, and deployment into practical solutions that can operate reliably in real-world environments.

## Areas of Focus

Her technical work and learning focus on:

- **Agentic AI Systems:** Designing tool-using, goal-driven agents
- **RAG Pipelines:** Embeddings, vector databases, and retrieval-driven reasoning
- **Backend Engineering:** Python and FastAPI for scalable AI services
- **AI + Web Integration:** Connecting AI backends with modern frontend applications
- **Production Deployment:** Shipping AI systems using platforms like Vercel and Railway

---

## Why This Book

This book was written to bridge the gap between **theoretical AI concepts** and **real-world implementation**.

Rather than focusing solely on models, it emphasizes:
- System architecture
- Data and retrieval pipelines
- Agent reasoning loops
- Deployment, monitoring, and iteration

The goal is to help engineers and builders move from experiments to **working AI systems**.

---

## Background

Mussarat has experience in full-stack development using technologies such as Next.js, Python, and FastAPI, and is actively expanding her expertise in **Agentic AI** through hands-on projects and structured learning. This book reflects that journey—learning deeply, building practically, and documenting systems clearly.
