# Implementation Plan: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

**Branch**: `001-physical-ai-book-plan` | **Date**: 2025-12-13 | **Spec**: [specs/001-physical-ai-book-plan/spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `physical-ai-book.spec.yaml` and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the systematic process for creating the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book using a Spec-Driven Development approach. The project will leverage Docusaurus to build a comprehensive, well-designed, and interactive online book, adhering strictly to the provided specification and constitution. The plan is broken down into distinct phases, from initial project setup to final task preparation, ensuring a structured and maintainable workflow.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown (MDX) for content, React (TypeScript/JavaScript) for Docusaurus components.
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus v2, React.
**Storage**: N/A (Content is stored in version-controlled Markdown files).
**Testing**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (No testing framework is specified. Suggest considering Playwright for E2E tests to validate layout, navigation, and interactivity).
**Target Platform**: Web (Static site generation for deployment on GitHub Pages and Vercel).
**Project Type**: Web application (Docusaurus project).
**Performance Goals**: Fast page loads (<2s), smooth scrolling animations, responsive design across all target breakpoints.
**Constraints**: Must adhere to the detailed `designSystem` in the specification, including color palettes, typography, and spacing. Must support both light and dark modes.
**Scale/Scope**: A multi-chapter book with appendices, a glossary, interactive components, and a full navigation system.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: All planning and implementation must adhere to the project constitution.*

- **[✓] I. Project Vision & Scope**: The plan directly addresses the creation of the comprehensive guide as defined.
- **[✓] II. Technology Stack**: The plan is centered around Docusaurus v2 and Markdown, as mandated.
- **[✓] III. Design & Theme**: The visual and layout planning phase is dedicated to implementing the specified clean, minimal, and professional design.
- **[✓] IV. Content Structure**: The content architecture phase maps directly to the chapter and section structure defined in the constitution.
- **[✓] V. Features & Functionality**: The plan includes strategies for implementing all required features like code blocks, internal linking, and media.
- **[✓] VI. Deployment Strategy**: The project structure and build process will be configured for GitHub Pages and Vercel.

**Structure Decision**: The project will follow the standard Docusaurus project structure. Content will be organized within the `/docs` directory, with subdirectories for each chapter. Custom React components will be built in `/src/components` to implement bespoke UI elements defined in the spec, such as `HeroSection` and `CalloutBox`.

---

## Execution Phases

### PHASE 1 — Initialization
- **Goal**: Prepare the Docusaurus project for content generation.
- **Inputs**:
  - `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
  - `physical-ai-book.spec.yaml`
- **Outputs**:
  - A fully initialized Docusaurus project.
  - `docusaurus.config.js` configured with the book's title, theme, navigation links, and footer content.
  - A `custom.css` file set up with the design system's CSS variables (colors, fonts, spacing) from the spec.
  - Placeholder files for the book's logo and favicon.
- **Dependencies**: None.

### PHASE 2 — Content Architecture Mapping
- **Goal**: Translate the specified content structure into a physical directory and file hierarchy.
- **Inputs**:
  - `contentStructure` from `physical-ai-book.spec.yaml`.
  - `IV. Content Structure` from `constitution.md`.
- **Outputs**:
  - A complete folder structure inside the `/docs` directory, with one folder per chapter and appendix.
  - Placeholder `_category_.json` files within each chapter folder to define sidebar labels and positions.
  - Initial, empty Markdown files for each planned section within the chapters.
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 completed.

### PHASE 3 — Visual & Layout Planning
- **Goal**: Implement the core visual and structural components defined in the specification.
- **Inputs**:
  - `designSystem`, `layout`, and `components` sections from `physical-ai-book.spec.yaml`.
- **Outputs**:
  - Custom React components created in `src/components` for: `HeroSection`, `SectionBanner`, and `CalloutBox`.
  - The main layout swizzled and modified to incorporate the specified header, footer, and sidebar dimensions.
  - `custom.css` populated with styles for typography, code blocks, tables, and other elements to match the spec.
  - A plan for image and diagram placement, including placeholder components.
- **Dependencies**: Phase 2 completed.

### PHASE 4 — Chapter Generation Strategy
- **Goal**: Define a reusable template and process for generating the content of each chapter.
- **Inputs**:
  - Content architecture from Phase 2.
  - Visual components from Phase 3.
- **Outputs**:
  - A standard chapter template (as a Markdown snippet or guideline) that includes a hero section, main content area, and demonstrates the use of callouts, code blocks, and images.
  - Clear rules for generating sections and subsections to maintain consistency.
  - A defined strategy for creating internal links between chapters and to the glossary.
- **Dependencies**: Phase 3 completed.

### PHASE 5 — Navigation & Structure Planning
- **Goal**: Configure the global and sidebar navigation to ensure a clear reading flow.
- **Inputs**:
  - Chapter hierarchy from Phase 2.
  - `navigation` and `sidebar` definitions from the spec and Docusaurus configuration.
- **Outputs**:
  - The main header navigation in `docusaurus.config.js` fully implemented.
  - The sidebar hierarchy configured in `sidebars.js` (or via autogenerated configs) to reflect the planned chapter and section order.
  - A strategy for placing appendices and the glossary in the navigation structure.
- **Dependencies**: Phase 4 completed.

### PHASE 6 — Quality & Consistency Validation
- **Goal**: Establish a set of rules and checks to ensure all generated content and UI elements are consistent and correct.
- **Inputs**:
  - All outputs from previous phases.
- **Outputs**:
  - A validation checklist (`validation-checklist.md`) covering:
    - Typographic consistency (headings, body text).
    - Correct usage of callout box types.
    - Consistent formatting of code blocks.
    - Adherence to naming conventions for files and components.
    - Verification of all internal and external links.
- **Dependencies**: Phase 5 completed.

### PHASE 7 — Task Preparation
- **Goal**: Break down the entire plan into a series of small, actionable, and atomic tasks for implementation.
- **Inputs**:
  - The completed and validated plan.
- **Outputs**:
  - A `tasks.md` file (to be generated by `/sp.tasks`) that lists discrete implementation tasks, such as "Create the Docusaurus project," "Generate the 'Foundations' chapter content," or "Implement the custom 'HeroSection' component."
  - Each task will have clear inputs, outputs, and acceptance criteria.
- **Dependencies**: Phase 6 completed.
